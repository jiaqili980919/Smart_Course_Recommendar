# Smart_Course_Recommendar
Since the advent of MOOCs, there has been an increase in the number of online courses, and often people are unaware of the most well-known courses across many disciplines. It is necessary to identify and suggest courses that are acceptable for a user in order to make the best education accessible to all users. This enhances learning skills and makes it simpler for users to learn about the courses. A lot of course information is available everywhere because of the recent creation of various MOOC platforms like edX, Coursera, Udacity, etc. These platforms have attracted millions of people who have signed up, taken the courses, and provided feedback. Users find it difficult to choose a specific course that is right for them and matches their learning pace because there is so much course material available. The conventional recommendation algorithms are inapplicable in such circumstances. The goal of this project is to create a system for recommending courses to users based on their prior learning experiences, preferred learning styles, and rate of learning. Our solution can be used to bolster the user experience by providing recommendations to the user based on user preferences to reduce user efforts and help users reach their learning goals. Moreover, this will help the stakeholderâ€™s platform by improvising User experience, increasing sales, increasing user retention, and most importantly increasing revenue.

Our team achieved our objectives through 6 steps:
 1.Web scrapping descriptive data directly from Coursera website
 2.Data Preprocessing and Data Analysis with Text-Preprocessing Methods
 3.Creating courses similarity matrix with topic modeling: LDA, SVD, and NMF combined with different vectorization
 4.Recommending similar courses with high similarity score based on users' input/interest
 5.Evaluating models based on topic coherence and further test the conclusions via A/B testing
 6.Building UI for users to interact with our product
