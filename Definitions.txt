Topic Modeling Summary:

Here are 2-line definitions for LDA, NMF, and SVD in topic modeling along with their differences:

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):

LDA is a probabilistic topic modeling technique that represents documents as a mixture of topics, where each topic is a probability distribution over words.
It assumes that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word in the document is generated by one of these topics.
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):

NMF is a matrix factorization technique used for unsupervised learning that factorizes a non-negative matrix into two non-negative matrices, where the columns of the matrices represent topics and the rows represent the documents.
It is often used in text mining and has the advantage of producing interpretable topics.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):

SVD is a linear algebra technique that factorizes a matrix into three matrices, where the middle matrix represents the underlying "concepts" or topics.
It is a commonly used technique for dimensionality reduction and has been applied to topic modeling by using the SVD to factorize the term-document matrix.
Differences:

LDA and NMF are both generative models, while SVD is not.
LDA and NMF are both designed to extract latent topics from text data, while SVD is a general-purpose dimensionality reduction technique.
LDA assumes a probabilistic generative model for documents, while NMF and SVD do not make explicit assumptions about the generative process.
NMF produces non-negative factor matrices, while SVD can produce negative values.
LDA and NMF can handle sparse data, while SVD requires a dense term-document matrix.
